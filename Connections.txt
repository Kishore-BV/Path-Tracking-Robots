Notes:-

-> The LFR and MSR works with 5 IR array Sensor where they can work till 3 mm line thickness.
-> The connections for both the robots are same.

Connection Between Arduino Nano and The Motor Driver:

Arduino Nano Pin 4 -> TB6612FNG AIN1
Arduino Nano Pin 3 -> TB6612FNG AIN2
Arduino Nano Pin 6 -> TB6612FNG BIN1
Arduino Nano Pin 7 -> TB6612FNG BIN2
Arduino Nano Pin 9 -> TB6612FNG PWMA
Arduino Nano Pin 10 -> TB6612FNG PWMB
Arduino Nano Pin 5 (for older boards) -> TB6612FNG STBY
Connect GNDs of both the Nano and TB6612FNG together
Provide appropriate VCC to the TB6612FNG according to motor specifications
